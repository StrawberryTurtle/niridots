# Installation Instructions


## Step 0: This is meant to be done from a fresh Arch install with pipewire. 
It will install everything i want in my entire desktop experience. 
Though it is fairly minimal as i dont use a lot of different packages very often.


## Step 1: Backup your .config
```mv ~/.config ~/.config.old```


## Step 2: Download the install script
```curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/StrawberryTurtle/niridots/main/nirinstall -o ~/nirinstall```


## Step 3: READ THE INSTALL SCRIPT. DO NOT RUN RANDOM SCRIPTS


## Step 4: Give permissions to run
```chmod +x nirinstall```


## Step 5: Run
```./nirinstall```
