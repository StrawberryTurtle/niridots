# Installation Instructions

## Step 0: This is meant to be done from a fresh Arch install with pipewire. 
### It will install everything i want in my entire desktop experience. 
### Though it is fairly minimal as i dont use a lot of different packages very often.

## Step 1: Download the install script
```curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/StrawberryTurtle/niridots/main/nirinstall -o ~/nirinstall```

## Step 2: READ THE INSTALL SCRIPT. DO NOT RUN RANDOM SCRIPTS

## Step 3: Give permissions to run
```chmod +x nirinstall```

## Step 4: Run
```./nirinstall```
